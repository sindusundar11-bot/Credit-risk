Interpretable Machine Learning for Credit Risk Assessment using SHAP Values
🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interpretable credit risk prediction model using machine learning and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
The goal is not only to achieve strong predictive accuracy, but also to provide transparent, regulator-friendly explanations for how individual loan risk scores are generated.
Financial institutions must justify automated credit decisions. This project simulates a real-world setting where both fairness and interpretability are essential.
🎯 Objectives
Build a robust classification model to predict loan default probability
Use a simulated or Kaggle credit-risk dataset
Generate global interpretability:
SHAP summary plots
Feature importance
Generate local interpretability:
SHAP force plots
SHAP waterfall plots
Explanations for high-risk and low-risk customers
Ensure fairness, transparency, and explainability in model decisions
Create a model that can be presented to stakeholders and regulators
Model Performance Metrics
Your evaluation includes:
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix
AUC-ROC Curve
Probability distribution for risk scores
These results show how well the model identifies defaulters versus safe borrowers.
🔎 Explainability With SHAP
Global Explanations
Identify top drivers of credit risk
Understand average feature influence across all customers
Visualizations:
SHAP Summary Plot
Feature Importance Plot
Local Explanations
Explain individual predictions for:
High-risk applicants
Low-risk applicants
Visualizations:
SHAP Force Plot
SHAP Waterfall Plot
These explanations help justify loan approvals or rejections.
🏦 Fairness & Regulatory Considerations
This project includes:
Checking feature influence to avoid discriminatory factors
Ensuring model interpretability for compliance
Documenting why decisions were made
Providing transparency in risk scoring
Using SHAP to explain “Why was this applicant classified as high-risk?”
